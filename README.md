# TikTok Repost Remover

A Python tool that automatically detects and removes **TikTok reposts** from your account.

## What are TikTok Reposts?

**TikTok reposts** are videos that you've shared from other creators to your own profile. They:
- Appear with a "repost" label
- Show the original creator's name
- Are found in the "Reposts" tab on your profile
- Are NOT your original content

This tool helps you clean up your profile by removing these shared videos.

## Features

- üîç **Smart Detection**: Finds all reposts in your Reposts tab
- ü§ñ **Automated Removal**: Uses TikTok's official "Remove repost" feature
- üîê **Secure Login**: Safe authentication with manual verification support
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with detailed logging
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Manual Selection**: Choose which reposts to remove
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Operation**: Only affects reposts, never your original content

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd repost-remover
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your TikTok credentials:
```
TIKTOK_USERNAME=your_username
TIKTOK_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```python
from tiktok_repost_remover import TikTokRepostRemover

# Initialize the remover
remover = TikTokRepostRemover()

# Login with your credentials
remover.login("your_username", "your_password", manual_verification=True)

# Navigate to reposts tab and remove all reposts
remover.remove_all_reposts()
```

### Manual Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the guided manual mode
python manual_mode.py

# Or with the main script
python main.py --no-headless --manual --dry-run
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Custom configuration
remover = TikTokRepostRemover(
    similarity_threshold=0.95,  # How similar videos need to be (0.0-1.0)
    batch_size=10,              # Number of videos to process at once
    headless=True               # Run browser in background
)

# Dry run (scan only, don't delete)
reposts = remover.scan_for_reposts(dry_run=True)
print(f"Found {len(reposts)} potential reposts")

# Remove specific reposts
remover.remove_specific_reposts(reposts[:5])  # Remove first 5
```

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Securely logs into your TikTok account using browser automation
2. **Navigate**: Goes to your profile's "Reposts" tab
3. **Collect**: Gathers all reposted videos (videos you've shared from others)
4. **Remove**: Uses TikTok's official "Remove repost" feature to clean them up
5. **Report**: Provides detailed logging of what was removed

## What Gets Removed vs. What Stays

‚úÖ **REMOVED (Reposts):**
- Videos you've shared from other creators
- Content with "repost" labels
- Videos in your "Reposts" tab

‚ùå **NEVER TOUCHED (Your Content):**
- Your original videos
- Videos you created and uploaded
- Content in your main profile tab

## Safety Features

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Confirmation Prompts**: Always asks before deleting videos
- üìù **Detailed Logging**: Logs all actions for review
- üîÑ **Undo Support**: Maintains a list of deleted videos for reference
- üõ°Ô∏è **Rate Limiting**: Respects TikTok's API limits to avoid account issues

## Configuration

You can customize the tool's behavior by modifying `config.py`:

- `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`: How similar videos need to be to be considered reposts (default: 0.9)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of videos to process simultaneously (default: 5)
- `DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS`: Delay between actions to avoid rate limiting (default: 2 seconds)
