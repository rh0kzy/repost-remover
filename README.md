# TikTok Repost Remover

A Python tool that automatically detects and removes reposts from your TikTok account.

## Features

- üîç **Smart Detection**: Uses image hashing and content analysis to identify reposts
- ü§ñ **Automated Removal**: Automatically deletes detected reposts
- üîê **Secure Login**: Safe authentication using your TikTok credentials
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with detailed logging
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Configurable similarity thresholds and batch processing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd repost-remover
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your TikTok credentials:
```
TIKTOK_USERNAME=your_username
TIKTOK_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```python
from tiktok_repost_remover import TikTokRepostRemover

# Initialize the remover
remover = TikTokRepostRemover()

# Login with your credentials
remover.login("your_username", "your_password")

# Scan and remove all reposts
remover.remove_all_reposts()
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Custom configuration
remover = TikTokRepostRemover(
    similarity_threshold=0.95,  # How similar videos need to be (0.0-1.0)
    batch_size=10,              # Number of videos to process at once
    headless=True               # Run browser in background
)

# Dry run (scan only, don't delete)
reposts = remover.scan_for_reposts(dry_run=True)
print(f"Found {len(reposts)} potential reposts")

# Remove specific reposts
remover.remove_specific_reposts(reposts[:5])  # Remove first 5
```

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Securely logs into your TikTok account using Selenium WebDriver
2. **Video Collection**: Gathers all videos from your profile
3. **Content Analysis**: Downloads and analyzes video thumbnails and metadata
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Uses perceptual hashing to identify similar content
5. **Smart Removal**: Keeps the oldest/most popular version and removes duplicates

## Safety Features

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Confirmation Prompts**: Always asks before deleting videos
- üìù **Detailed Logging**: Logs all actions for review
- üîÑ **Undo Support**: Maintains a list of deleted videos for reference
- üõ°Ô∏è **Rate Limiting**: Respects TikTok's API limits to avoid account issues

## Configuration

You can customize the tool's behavior by modifying `config.py`:

- `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`: How similar videos need to be to be considered reposts (default: 0.9)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of videos to process simultaneously (default: 5)
- `DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS`: Delay between actions to avoid rate limiting (default: 2 seconds)
